# * seems like Walmart has tried to adopt this idea also but its not accurate either,
# * this model can be used throughout even small pinpad based kiosks for swipe or insert payment



# * model could be adopted to customers at registers paying for in store items 

# * QR code instead of NFC to save money no need for plastic cutting and electronics 
# * QR code
# * viewable on gas pump screen to allow import directly into user phone as a screenshot and or app version receipt system maybe similar to apple "wallet" called "receipts"

# * as APP


# * for sending the gas receipt directly to the phone as a snap shot image to save on the phone or email detection via NFC to email receipt to phone
# * only by proximity of the phone being within an arm extended length to a small sensor near the display of the gas purchase amount  or receptacle to take receipt 



# * possible bind through QR code import instead save time with NFC electronics QR can store reciept data as a saleable item

# * a major reason to implement this tax purposes or proof of gas payment for ease of use when pump is out of receipt paper or to reduce carbon also by saving paper  lack of traveling inside to retrieve reciept or otherwise


* possible timeout to get digital copy of receipt after payment after answering yes to want a receipt then allowing a count down timer to hold the phone near the sensor next to the receipt receptacle to digitally aquire the receipt into the purchasees phone who paid for gas


* 6 digit OTP style pairing proves receipt purhaser via phone retreival with(out) timeout to retrieve reciept 5-10 minutes within purchase time
